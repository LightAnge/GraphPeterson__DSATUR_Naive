# GraphPeterson__DSATUR_Naive
Graph of Peterson generation (k,n parameters) with algorithms of L(a,b)-coloration (DSTUR and Naive) and optimization of Naive from O(n^2) to O(n) complexity.

# Explanation :
This was an university project and we had to code the problem and resolve it. I made to code the project and do mathematics demonstration and my mate made the report (university is a little unfair but I had my year with succes and he miss out).
